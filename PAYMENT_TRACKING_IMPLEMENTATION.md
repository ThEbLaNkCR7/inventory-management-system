# Payment Tracking System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive payment tracking system for the inventory management system. The system now tracks outstanding payments for both purchases and sales, providing better financial visibility and cash flow management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Tracking Fields

#### Purchase Model Updates
- `totalAmount`: Total cost of the purchase (quantity × unit price)
- `paidAmount`: Amount already paid
- `paymentStatus`: Current payment status (Pending, Partial, Paid, Overdue)
- `dueDate`: Payment due date
- `paymentTerms`: Payment terms (Immediate, Net 30, Net 60, Net 90)

#### Sale Model Updates
- `totalAmount`: Total revenue from the sale (quantity × sale price)
- `paidAmount`: Amount already received
- `paymentStatus`: Current payment status (Pending, Partial, Paid, Overdue)
- `dueDate`: Payment due date
- `paymentTerms`: Payment terms (Immediate, Net 30, Net 60, Net 90)

### 2. Payment History Model

New `Payment` model to track individual payment transactions:
- `transactionId`: Reference to purchase or sale
- `transactionType`: "Purchase" or "Sale"
- `amount`: Payment amount
- `paymentDate`: Date of payment
- `paymentMethod`: Cash, Bank Transfer, Check, Credit Card, Digital Payment
- `referenceNumber`: Check number, transaction ID, etc.
- `notes`: Additional notes
- `paidBy`: Name of person/company who made payment
- `recordedBy`: User who recorded the payment

### 3. API Endpoints

#### `/api/payments` (GET, POST)
- GET: Retrieve all payment records
- POST: Record a new payment and update transaction status

#### `/api/payments/stats` (GET)
- Get comprehensive payment statistics including:
  - Outstanding amounts for purchases and sales
  - Overdue payments
  - Payment method distribution
  - Recent payments
  - Net cash flow

### 4. UI Components

#### Payment Tracking Page (`/components/payments/PaymentsPage.tsx`)
- **Overview Dashboard**: Shows payment statistics and summaries
- **Outstanding Payments**: Lists all unpaid transactions
- **Overdue Payments**: Highlights past-due payments
- **Recent Payments**: Shows latest payment transactions
- **Payment Recording**: Form to record new payments

#### Enhanced Purchase/Sale Pages
- Payment status columns in tables
- Payment terms and due date fields in forms
- Visual indicators for payment status (badges)
- Outstanding amount calculations

### 5. Context Integration

Updated `InventoryContext` with payment-related functions:
- `recordPayment()`: Record new payments
- `getPaymentStats()`: Get payment statistics
- `getOutstandingPayments()`: Get unpaid transactions
- `getOverduePayments()`: Get overdue transactions

## Payment Status Logic

### Status Determination
1. **Pending**: No payments made yet
2. **Partial**: Some payments made but not full amount
3. **Paid**: Full amount has been paid
4. **Overdue**: Payment is past due date and not fully paid

### Automatic Status Updates
- Status is automatically calculated when payments are recorded
- Overdue status is checked against due dates
- Payment status updates are reflected in real-time

## Usage Examples

### Recording a Payment
```javascript
// Record a payment for a purchase
await recordPayment({
  transactionId: "purchase_id",
  transactionType: "Purchase",
  amount: 1000,
  paymentDate: "2024-01-15",
  paymentMethod: "Bank Transfer",
  referenceNumber: "TXN123456",
  notes: "Partial payment",
  paidBy: "Supplier Name",
  recordedBy: "user@email.com"
})
```

### Getting Payment Statistics
```javascript
const stats = await getPaymentStats()
console.log(stats.summary.totalOutstanding) // Total outstanding amount
console.log(stats.summary.netCashFlow) // Net cash flow
```

## Database Migration

A migration script (`update-payment-fields.js`) was created to:
- Update existing purchases and sales with payment tracking fields
- Calculate total amounts for existing transactions
- Set appropriate payment statuses based on current data
- Preserve existing data while adding new functionality

## Benefits

1. **Better Cash Flow Management**: Track outstanding receivables and payables
2. **Improved Financial Visibility**: Real-time view of payment status
3. **Automated Status Tracking**: Automatic calculation of payment status
4. **Payment History**: Complete audit trail of all payments
5. **Overdue Alerts**: Identify past-due payments quickly
6. **Financial Reporting**: Enhanced reporting capabilities

## Future Enhancements

1. **Payment Reminders**: Automated notifications for upcoming due dates
2. **Payment Scheduling**: Schedule recurring payments
3. **Bank Integration**: Direct bank account integration
4. **Payment Analytics**: Advanced payment trend analysis
5. **Multi-currency Support**: Handle different currencies
6. **Payment Approval Workflow**: Approval process for large payments

## Technical Notes

- All payment calculations are done server-side for accuracy
- Payment status is automatically updated when payments are recorded
- The system maintains data integrity with proper validation
- Payment history is preserved for audit purposes
- The UI provides real-time updates when payments are recorded
